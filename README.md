# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze the Amazon reviews written by Amazon Vine members as they receive products and review them. In this particular instance, we will be analyzing the __musical instruments__ sold on the platform. To carry out this analysis, PySpark will be used to perform the "Extract, Transform, Load" process, where the cleaned-up dataset will be connected to an AWS RDS, and then loaded into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark will be used to determine whether Vine members gave overall positive or negative reviews of the products.

## Results

In the process of this analysis, first, we created a table that contained each review of the musical instrument product, the amount of helpful and total votes, and the rating given. There was also a column indicating whether the user was part of the Vine program. This created an initial dataframe where we further processed to draw conclusions from:

We filtered the above data to only include reviews that had 20 or more total votes and with 50% or more of them being helpful votes:

The next step was to separate the reviews based on whether they were paid (Yes to the Vine proTogram) or unpaid (No to the Vine program).

The paid reviews include:

And the unpaid reviews include:

As seen from the above dataframe tables, we come up with the following numerical figures:
- Total number of Vine reviews: 60
- Total number of non-Vine reviews: 14477
- Number of 5-star Vine reviews: 34
- Number of 5-star non-Vine reviews: 8212
- % of Vine reviews that were 5-stars: 0.412%
- % of non-Vine reviews that were 5-stars: 99.6%


## Summary

From our above analysis, it is clear that there is __NO__ positivity bias for reviews in the Amazon Vine program. Close to all (99.6%) of the 5-star reviews were unpaid, and on the contrary, 0.41% of the 5-star reviews were paid. This seems to suggest that being a part of the program did not exactly incentivize users to give high ratings.
However, 5-star ratings are not the only positive ratings. It will be beneficial to conduct the same analysis as the above but for __4-star ratings__ to determine if there may be a difference between paid vs. unpaid there. This can be done with almost the same code as above but changing the filter criterion to have "star-rating == '4'" instead.

# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze the Amazon reviews written by Amazon Vine members as they receive products and review them. In this particular instance, we will be analyzing the musical instruments sold on the platform. To carry out this analysis, PySpark will be used to perform the "Extract, Transform, Load" process, where the cleaned-up dataset will be connected to an AWS RDS, and then loaded into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark will be used to determine whether Vine members gave overall positive or negative reviews of the products.
